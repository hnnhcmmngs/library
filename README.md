# library

This is an example of a library page that allows a user to keep track of their books and each book's read status. The books are not saved to any type of storage that preserves them between pages reloads, but this will be added in the future.

The purpose of this project is to become more familiar with objects, object constructors, and prototypes as well as achieve further practice with forms and grids.
